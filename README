pod-mode.el - A major mode for editing .pod-files in (X)Emacs

POD is the Plain Old Documentation format of Perl.
This mode mainly defines a grammar for syntax highlighting.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:

Put "pod-mode.el" into your load-path and the following
into your ~/.emacs:

  (require 'pod-mode)

To associate pod-mode with .pod files add the following
into your ~/.emacs

  (setq auto-mode-alist
    (append auto-mode-alist
      '(("\\.pod$" . pod-mode))))

To automatically turn on font-lock-mode add the following
into your ~/.emacs

  (add-hook 'pod-mode-hook 'font-lock-mode)
